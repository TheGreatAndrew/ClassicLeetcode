### terms
Continous Integration : commit code to a shared repo frequently
Github Actions : automate CI services 
virtual machine : bulky and slow
container : conceptually similar to virtual machine with 1 key difference. Virtual machine virtualize software, containers only virtualize OS. All apps (containers) run in shared kernel
image : snapshot of your software and dependencies. Images is immutable, and can be use for multiple containers 

##### guide 
test build deploy
work flow 
    commit codes with CI 
    CI Server notifies if it's success or fail
    avoid git merge hell
work flow 
    Github Actions use deploy.yml to detects changes 
    it will run on Linux container 
    build steps : get codes, set up, run build deploy
Docker : package software into containers
    Docker file (Dockerfile): how to build an image. Setup environment, image 
    Docker image
    Docker container 
Kubernetes : manage and automate containerized workloads on the cloud 
    Kubernetes is like a conductor, manage Containers 
    can auto-heal 
    cluster : a system that is deployed on Kubernetes
    Control Plane : brain of operations
    ETCD : Kubernetes's kye-value database 
    nodes : worker machines 
    each node runs a kubelet, tiny application to communicates back with Control Plane 
    each node has multiple Pods, which is smallest deployable unit
    Kubernetes do networking, secret management and persistence storage 
    yaml [Objects]: describe desired state of your Cluster 
Jenkins
