### general
test build deploy
Continous Integration : commit code to a shared repo frequently
work flow 
    commit codes with CI 
    CI Server notifies if it's success or fail
    avoid git merge hell
Github Actions : automate CI services 
work flow 
    Github Actions use deploy.yml to detects changes 
    it will run on Linux container 
    build steps : get codes, set up, run build deploy
Docker : package software into containers
    Docker file (Dockerfile): how to build an image. Setup environment, image 
    Docker image
    Docker container 
virtual machine : bulky and slow
container : conceptually similar to virtual machine with 1 key difference. Virtual machine virtualize software, containers only virtualize OS. All apps (containers) run in shared kernel
image : snapshot of your software and dependencies. Images is immutable, and can be use for multiple containers 
Kubernetes : manage and automate containerized workloads on the cloud 
    Kubernetes is like a conductor, manage Containers 
    can auto-heal 
    cluster : a system that is deployed on Kubernetes
    Control Plane : brain of operations
    ETCD : Kubernetes's kye-value database 
    nodes : worker machines 
    each node runs a kubelet, tiny application to communicates back with Control Plane 
    each node has multiple Pods, which is smallest deployable unit
    Kubernetes do networking, secret management and persistence storage 
    yaml [Objects]: describe desired state of your Cluster 
    

### real-life case
what I understand 
    


docker
Jenkins
Kubernetes
CI/CD:
advanced
