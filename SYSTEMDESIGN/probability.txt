### general 
polynomial : 2x^2 + 3x 
coefficient : number floating 
binomial coefficient ->
    C(n, k)= n!/[k!(n-k)!]
    how many ways to draw 6 cards out of a pack of 10 cards -> n=10,k=6

 create and sample from a discrete distribution
    Yeah. Take probabilities,convert to cumulative distribution function by mapping categories to ranges, generate random number between 0-1, then perform binary search over these discrete categories to determine which range the random number falls within.
    But what if you weren't given probabilities? What if you were given rarities, where there larger the number the more rare it is.

Bernouli : either success or fail. 
    example : if a random American is selected, what is their probabilities of being a heart surgeon
    N : number of events 
    P : number of successes

Binomial (Independent Bernouli Trials where Bernouli is N=1) : distribution of the number of successes in N independent Bernouli trials 
    example : if a coin is tossed 20 times, what is the probabilites heads come up 14 times 
    The number of trials is fixed 
    The number of success is random variable 

Geometric (Independent Bernouli Trials) : number of trials needed to get first success 
    example : if a coin is repeated tossed, what is the probabilites the first time heads appear on the 8th toss ? 

Negative Bionomial (Independent Bernouli Trials) : number of trials needed to get certain number of successes 
    example : if a coin is repeated tossed, what is the probabilites the third time heads appear on the 9th toss ? 
    The number of trials is random variable  
    The number of success is fixed

Hypergeometric (similar to Binomial but cards are w'ith replacement') : trials not independent
    example : if 5 cards are drawn 'without replacement' from a well shuffled deck, what is the probability exactly 3 hearts are drawn?

Poisson : number of events in a given time. If events occur randomly and independently 
    example : probabilites of 4 car accidents in a given week
