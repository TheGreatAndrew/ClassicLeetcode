5 Design Patterns Every Engineer Should Know
    Singleton -> 1 instance. hard to reverting.
    Facade -> abstraction. you can oversimplied, you have leaky abstraction. over-verticalization too specifics for a single use case.
    Bridge/ Adapter -> interface DB, concrete DB
    Observer -> publisher, subscriber.  
Systems Design Interview Concepts (for software engineers / full-stack web)
    load design 
    -> for web server
    distribute traffic to different services for throughput latency. NGNIX.
    DNS load balancing -> one url has many IP addresses. Simple, but not many customizations
    caching
    -> image use CDN
    database usually is the first to go down
    in-memory cache doesnâ€™t need to hit the disk at all
    memcache. CDN content delivery file to cache static assets, HTML, Javascript, video
    pool technique -> first time load slow, the after that all users in that area will be fast.
    push technique -> push your files into CD
    Amazon s3 
    database schema
    -> for database servers 
    database indexes are important -> 
    Slave-master replications 
    -> for database servers
    consistency -> while writing, we can also reading that info
    database sharding
    -> for writes
    sharding database to multiple databases
    vertical sharding -> user table, tweet table
    horitonztal sharding -> single table in multiple machines
    API design 
    data transport mechanism -> JSON or protocol buffers
    offline usage
