# Height: Imagine measuring a person's height, we do it from toe to head (leaf to root)
# Depth: Imagine measuring depth of a sea, we do it from earth's surface to ocean bed (root to leaf)
# Level : 

# depth first search : use stack (recursion stack, or stack)
    # inorder traversal (Left-Root-Right)
    # preorder traversal (Root-Left-Right)
    # postorder traversal (Left-Right-Root)
    # best for path finding, building path, determing path
# breath first search (level order traversal) : use queue
