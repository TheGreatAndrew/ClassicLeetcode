user -> DNA -> IP address -> HTTP requests to get data 
Relational databases (SQL, relational database management system (RDBMS) -> 
NoSQL -> 4 categories key-value stores, graph stores, column stores, and document stores ->

vertical scailing : more power to 1 server 
horizontal scailing : add more servers 
load balancer : load balancer distributes traffic among servers that are defined in a load-balanced set
database replication
