# memoization top-down
# recursion
# Generally, the bottom-up approach uses the tabulation technique, while the top-down approach uses the recursion (with memorization) technique.
# when to use -> max/ min counting quantities 

# tips on how to deal with it
# DP is simply optimization technique to solve subproblem, and to store result
# step 1 -> changing params
# step 2 -> recurrence relation
# step 3 -> base cases
# step 4 -> tabulation or memo
