    general
        if sorted array -> binary search, two pointers
        if tree -> recursion, 2 pointers, recursion 
        if graph -> bfs, dfs 
        if recursion is banned -> stack 
        top/ least K items -> heap
        common string -> dictionary, trie 

    weird like DP 
        if permutation, subset -> backtracking 
        solve in-place -> swap correspending value, store one or more different values in the same pointer
        maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options -> dynamic programming
