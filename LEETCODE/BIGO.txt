### AMORTIZE 
explained
    ArrayList can grow. And insertion is O(1), but once it hits the capacity, it will create a new array with O(n) time
    ArrayList grow 2x, it will create 2x array size, and copy x elements from old array, and destroy old array 
    X insertions take 0(2X) time. The amortized time for each insertion is 0(1) ....
