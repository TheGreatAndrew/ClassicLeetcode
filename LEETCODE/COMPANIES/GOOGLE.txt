Mathematics: S ome interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than
at other companies because counting problems, probability problems and other Discrete Math 101
situations surround us. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching
yourself) the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with
n-choose-k problems and their ilk
graph 
    distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection
    three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list)
    basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. knows their tradeoffs 
system 
    process, thread 
    OOP
    internet 
    and more

speak out loud 
computational complexity, improving later is valuable
"You won't be expected to answer questions requiring some obscure and highly domain-specific algorithm."
simple, correct input. test boundary input. malformed input 
best practice -> explain thought, open-ended question have to verify, practice on whiteboard
