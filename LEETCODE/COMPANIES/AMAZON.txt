phone is esy
Only Amazon needs Leetcode, Behavior, OOD -> no neeed to prepare
1 week of focusing on easy phone, no pressure < just apply for jobs 
i haven't really prepared last week, or 2 weeks for leetcode 
priority not finding Amazon job, it's normal job and startup
Foster passed with less Leetcode 


Foster's Amazon 
interview 1: GPS question
Interview 2: SD / Component design question
Interview 3: OOP/OOD "Design a class that does X, now implement logging and unit tests etc, what if we changed it to minimize X with Y constraint"
Interview 4: Read this log file and do X

Norm 
all of them have Behavioral at beginning. 
advices - be calm 
interview 1 Coding -> she asks for resume, technical, dynamic programming bottom up. Matrix Word Search in matrix, how many ways. Follow-up, Shortest path. 
interview 2 Coding -> hashmap very easily. Find palindrome, reverse.
interview 3 System Design -> Very Easy. what classes you will be using. 
interview 4 Coding -> String Manipulation. Greedy. Medium-Hard. giving a letter, find how many ways, rearrange words. No Behavioral. 


Who Shall Be Nameless
log info to analyze info -> how to read FILE
question 1 : log aggregation, timestamp 
    first part : log between each hours, 1 and 2 am 
    second part : last 100 or last k log -> stream   
    third part : get matrix and ranking -> get duration, get 5 slowest requests 
    scalable question -> sometimes ask 2 questions, this is the only question, if finished first and MAYBE second -> L4

### LOGGING 
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/
    approach 2 ->
        sort with order (0, 'art can', 'let1')
        maxsplit -> split input to identifier and rest 
        (0, 'art can', 'let1') -> 0 is letter so sort first, next sort lexicographically with 'art can', if still the same then sort by identifer
https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/989768/amazon-oa-2020-transaction-logs
    question -> 
        intput -> [user1, user2, transactions] and threshold
        output -> return list of userId occurence that passed the threshold, if user1=user2 count as 1 
    how to do ->
        [345366 38239 23]
        join them into string, already have space so no need for ' ' -> ''.join
        from string split to list -> .split()
        count the occurences 
        later loop find the one > threshold
