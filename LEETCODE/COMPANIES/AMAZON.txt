phone is esy
Only Amazon needs Leetcode, Behavior, OOD -> no neeed to prepare
1 week of focusing on easy phone, no pressure < just apply for jobs 
i haven't really prepared last week, or 2 weeks for leetcode 
priority not finding Amazon job, it's normal job and startup
Foster passed with less Leetcode
