    lexicographical ->
        just normal dictionary order, but last occurence exception
    how to do ->
        (lexicographical)
        (monotonic increasing stack, think about the last occurences) 
        store the last occurences 
        keep adding to stack
        if new letter is smaller, and the letter before still occur later -> remove previous letter
        why remove from the right -> "bcab" outputs "bca" because c no recurring

    time ->
        stack will contain max 26 character, so its 26N max, but in terms of time-complexity, it is O(M*N) where M is number of distinct characters.
