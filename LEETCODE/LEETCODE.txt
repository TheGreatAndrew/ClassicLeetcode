############### HOW TO SOLVE LEETCODE 
My Cheatsheet 
    a 

For matrix,
    if directions allowed are left, right, up, down then bfs/dfs. 
    If minimum path, then bfs. 
    If a path has a value associated with it, then djask.
    If directions allowed are (left and up) or (right and down), then dp.
    If direction is either horizontal or vertical, then 2 pointers or just a loop going row by row and col by col!

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/552835/how-i-found-a-new-bay-area-faang-job-in-1-34-months
did 180 questions
doing 4-10 a day after work
study methodology ->
    solve 3-4 questions, and google different methods for already solved ones
    if stuck, look at solutions, then replace with yr code snippet
    study all the tags 

https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews
do bfs for Easy 
while solving, read the theory before of during 



############### HOW MANY LEETCODE IS ENOUGH
https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/g7bc48/how_much_leetcode_practice_is_enough_for_fang/
    doing a couple of related problems like this for 8 weeks should be enough for FAANG
    20 easy, 70 medium and 10 hard are enough for FAANG internships
    It depends greatly, but 100 is a good rough approximation.
    FB's interview format is 2 medium-ish problems in 45 minutes and besides coding you need some spare time for chit chat

    it's mostly luck that you don't get some kuck with a huge ego interviewing you
    For Amazon -> 2, For FG -> 400+
    Like someone else said, itâ€™s 110% the kind of interviewer you get, as long as you can easily solve LC medium

### HOW TO SOLVE LEETCODE 
start with brute force
O(2^n) -> when we have 2 choices each recursion, and we do it n times
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQp1OG7aSwg 1 recursive has 2 small recursives so 2^n
O(logn) -> when n keep dividing by 2 to reach 1, n/(2^i)<=1 is n <= 2^i is log2n<=1
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9152890/what-would-cause-an-algorithm-to-have-olog-n-complexity?rq=1
Big O https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly?rq=1
    O(logn) binary search
    O(nlogn) sorting
When read solutions
    read explanation and trying to pseudo code, then read solution code 
Most subarray problems are solved using Sliding Window or Two Pointers or through DP. Check Grokking the Coding Interview - designgurus.org

    combine with https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8aofxg/big_4_discussion_april_08_2018/dx0nwl9/
    general
        if sorted array -> binary search, two pointers
        if tree -> recursion, 2 pointers, recursion 
        if graph -> bfs, dfs 
        if recursion is banned -> stack 
        top/ least K items -> heap
        common string -> dictionary, trie 

    weird like DP 
        if permutation, subset -> backtracking 
        solve in-place -> swap correspending value, store one or more different values in the same pointer
        maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options -> dynamic programming 



### TODO 
@standardquestion 
    leave it here cause these are topics i stuck on, it's easier to manage, and not get lost 
    bit manipuation -> 
    serialize tree ->
    LRU but not OrderedDict

only BFS and DFS. no advanced graph. higher standards about your ability to solve new problems with basic CS knowledge.

### my guide 
start coding guide
10 minutes whiteboard, if stuck go read hints
30 minutes coding, if stuck go read solution 
if read solution, later come back and solve
if brute force O(n^2), first technique you can try is sorting inputs

when stuck
relax a little 
read the description and write my pseudocode
