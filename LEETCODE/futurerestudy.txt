Identify 
    general
        if sorted array -> binary search, two pointers
        if tree -> recursion, 2 pointers, recursion 
        if graph -> bfs, dfs 
        if recursion is banned -> stack 
        top/ least K items -> heap
        common string -> dictionary, trie 

    weird like DP 
        if permutation, subset -> backtracking 
        solve in-place -> swap correspending value, store one or more different values in the same pointer
        maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options -> dynamic programming 
        DP is simply optimization technique to solve subproblem, and to store result
        # step 1 -> changing params
        # step 2 -> recurrence relation
        # step 3 -> base cases
        # step 4 -> tabulation or memo

    for matrix,
        if directions allowed are left, right, up, down then bfs/dfs. 
        If minimum path, then bfs. 
        If a path has a value associated with it, then djask.
        If directions allowed are (left and up) or (right and down), then dp.
        If direction is either horizontal or vertical, then 2 pointers or just a loop going row by row and col by col!

    for graph,
        Height: Imagine measuring a person's height, we do it from toe to head (leaf to root)
        Depth: Imagine measuring depth of a sea, we do it from earth's surface to ocean bed (root to leaf)
        depth first search : use stack (recursion stack, or stack)
            # inorder traversal (Left-Root-Right)
            # preorder traversal (Root-Left-Right)
            # postorder traversal (Left-Right-Root)
            # best for path finding, building path, determing path
        breath first search (level order traversal) : use queue 
        # https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1326900/graph-algorithms-problems-to-practice
        # Union–find data structure or disjoint-set data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
        # minimum spanning tree (MST) : is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
        # Bellman Ford : Is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
        # Floyd Warshall : Is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
        # Eulearian Path : Is an algorithm that finds a path that uses every edge in a graph only once.
