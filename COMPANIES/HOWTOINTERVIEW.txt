    Second, when personality matters, it's not about cracking a joke or two. It's about your general personality. Don't just be open to feedback; be excited about getting feedback. Be energetic about solving a hard problem. Be interested in what the interviewer is saying. Show strong communication skills. Be a happy, energetic person who is excited about solving tough problems.
