### HOW TO PREPARE LEETCODE
https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/552835/how-i-found-a-new-bay-area-faang-job-in-1-34-months
did 180 questions
doing 4-10 a day after work
study methodology ->
    solve 3-4 questions, and google different methods for already solved ones
    if stuck, look at solutions, then replace with yr code snippet
    study all the tags 

https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews
do bfs for Easy 
while solving, read the theory before of during 





### HOW MANY LEETCODE IS ENOUGH
https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/g7bc48/how_much_leetcode_practice_is_enough_for_fang/
    doing a couple of related problems like this for 8 weeks should be enough for FAANG
    20 easy, 70 medium and 10 hard are enough for FAANG internships
    It depends greatly, but 100 is a good rough approximation.
    FB's interview format is 2 medium-ish problems in 45 minutes and besides coding you need some spare time for chit chat


https://www.teamblind.com/post/Average-number-of-leetcode-for-FANG-gWXKiKNf
    it's mostly luck that you don't get some kuck with a huge ego interviewing you
    For Amazon -> 2, For FG -> 400+
    Like someone else said, itâ€™s 110% the kind of interviewer you get, as long as you can easily solve LC medium




### HOW TO SOLVE LEETCODE 
start with brute force
O(2^n) -> when we have 2 choices each recursion, and we do it n times
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQp1OG7aSwg 1 recursive has 2 small recursives so 2^n
O(logn) -> when n keep dividing by 2 to reach 1, n/(2^i)<=1 is n <= 2^i is log2n<=1
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9152890/what-would-cause-an-algorithm-to-have-olog-n-complexity?rq=1
Big O https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly?rq=1
    O(logn) binary search
    O(nlogn) sorting
When read solutions
    read explanation and trying to pseudo code, then read solution code 
Most subarray problems are solved using Sliding Window or Two Pointers or through DP. Check Grokking the Coding Interview - designgurus.org
